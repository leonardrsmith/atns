# Some rough exploratory content analysis of ATNS

 * [./lodgement-old-type.xml](lodgement-old-type.xml) ATNS "Type of Agreement/Event/Corporate Body" (from the old lodgement page???)
 * [./lodgement-old-subject.xml](lodgement-old-subject.xml) ATNS "Subject Matter (Category)" (from the old lodgement page???)
 
 Also captured in old form:
 
   * "Name/Title of Agreement/ Event/ Corporate body" (as text?)
	 * "Date" (date of what -- agreement effective? could be many things here?)
	 * "Location (State/Territory, Town)" (location of what? text? geospatial boundaries?)
	 * "Summary / Details": (text only? are URLs allowed? 

## Questions

  * must be more structured than reflected here to obtain relationships?
  * who is doing that work? humans? 
  * how and who decides if a new EntityID is to be created?
  * what is the actual database schema?
