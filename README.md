# Thoughts regarding the ATNS and sustainability

## Current System

### Social architecture?

  * who takes responsibility for keeping it running: now? future? Is it grant-dependant?
  * what governance processes govern its usage, development, future?
  * what structures are established to communicate with users and potential information providers?
  * what intitutional and financial base underpins those processes?

### Technical architecture?

  * backend database: software?, schema?, scale?, how deployed? how managed? does it change? future plans?
  * frontend website: https://www.atns.net.au/ (squarespace?)
  * changes - how entered? how are relationships entered (e.g. associations between agreements and organisations)?
  * what is the technical debt, cost of running? Up to date? Secure? 
  * Is it at risk of becomeing an "orphan database" in future?
