# Thoughts regarding the ATNS and sustainability

## Current System

### Social architecture?

  * who takes responsibility for keeping it running: now? future? Is it grant-dependant?
  * what governance processes govern it's usage, development, future?
  * what structures are established to communicate with users and potential information providers?
  * what intitutional and financial base underpins those processes?

### Technical architecture?

  * backend database: software?, schema?, scale?, how deployed? how managed? does it change? future plans?
  * frontend website: https://www.atns.net.au/ (squarespace?)
  * changes - how entered? how are relationships entered (e.g. associations between agreements and organisations)?
  * what is the technical debt, cost of running? Up to date? Secure? 
  * Is it at risk of becomeing an "orphan database" in future?

## Observations of current content

  * is this the current data capture form of the new site??: [https://www.atns.net.au/contact-us](https://www.atns.net.au/contact-us)
  * or does the old site data capture form still in play: [https://database.atns.net.au/lodge.asp](https://database.atns.net.au/lodge.asp)
  
## Potential as a National Data Asset Stream 3 of ARDC

 * high level documentation of agreements of many types from many varied sources: very high policy/planning value to many parties;
 * do all agreements have a spatial component? If yes - GA may be a potential partner? If no, how can this be rectified?
 * relationships to legislation, organisations, jurisdictions etc.. -- very high potential for linked data;
 * "pointers" to external sources are sometimes text, sometimes URLs, sometimes 404's (not found/"link rot");
 * extremely high potential as a "use case" for information providers to support linked data and persistent identifiers
 
In summary, the ATNS has very high potential as being a HAAS-I National Data Asset. With appropriate institutional level support for stimulating governance level discussions around what kind of things require "authoritative" and "persistent" machine readable identification and, in particular, the ability to retain the integrity of those identifiers over time is an important use case.

However, from observations based only exploring the front-end website, the resources in ATNS are human readable only (no embedded machine readable metadata beyond the whole of site level was evident afaict).
